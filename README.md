# Advanced Speech Recognition Techniques Project

This project aims to explore and implement several cutting-edge techniques in the field of speech recognition. The goal is to build a modular framework that allows for experimentation with novel approaches to audio-to-text conversion.

## Core Features & Goals

The project focuses on four main research-oriented ASR techniques:

1.  **Spectral Tokenization**:
    *   Instead of traditional acoustic features or direct waveform-to-text, this approach involves tokenizing audio into discrete spectral units. These units might represent phonemes, sub-phonemes, or learned acoustic building blocks.
    *   The goal is to decode text directly from these spectral tokens, potentially leading to more robust and efficient models.

2.  **Semantic Hashing**:
    *   This technique uses deep learning to map audio segments (e.g., words, short phrases) to compact binary codes or dense semantic vectors (hashes).
    *   The key idea is that semantically similar audio segments should have similar hash codes.
    *   This enables ultra-fast transcription or retrieval for known segments via lookup in a hash table, which could be particularly useful for commands, named entities, or frequent phrases.

3.  **Audio-to-Text via Latent Space Navigation**:
    *   This involves training a model (e.g., an autoencoder, VAE) to learn a rich, continuous latent representation of speech.
    *   Transcription is then framed as a problem of "navigating" this latent space – finding a trajectory or sequence of points in the latent space that corresponds to the input audio's content and can be decoded to text.
    *   This could offer more expressive representations than discrete tokens alone.

4.  **Multi-Language Embedding Space**:
    *   The objective is to create a single, shared embedding space where speech from various languages is represented.
    *   In this space, similar sounds or semantic concepts across different languages should be mapped to nearby points.
    *   This can facilitate seamless switching between languages during transcription, enable mixed-language ASR, and allow for transfer learning across languages. Models like XLS-R or MMS from Hugging Face are examples of this direction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Pip (Python package installer)
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd advanced-speech-recognition
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note*: The `requirements.txt` file lists several large libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection. For GPU support, you might need to install specific versions of PyTorch/TensorFlow compatible with your CUDA toolkit. Refer to their official installation guides.

### Basic Usage

The `src/main.py` script provides a command-line interface to demonstrate the functionalities of the different modules. Since the components are currently stubs, their output will be simulated.

```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is activated
# Run from the project root directory
python -m src.main --help
```

Example commands:

```bash
# Demonstrate spectral tokenization (using dummy audio if --audio_file is not provided)
python -m src.main tokenize --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav

# Demonstrate semantic hashing
python -m src.main hash --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav

# Demonstrate latent space navigation
python -m src.main navigate --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav

# Demonstrate multilingual embedding
python -m src.main multilingual_embed --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav --language es

# Run a conceptual full pipeline demo
python -m src.main full_pipeline_demo --audio_file path/to/your/audio.wav
```
Replace `path/to/your/audio.wav` with an actual audio file for more meaningful (though still simulated) output.

## Development

*   **Source Code**: Core logic is within the `src/` directory. Each main feature has its own module.
*   **Utilities**: Common functions like audio loading and feature extraction are in `src/utils.py`.
*   **Experimentation**: `notebooks/` can be used for interactive development and exploration.
*   **Testing**: `tests/` will contain unit and integration tests (currently stubs).

## Contribution

This is a foundational setup. Contributions are welcome to implement the actual algorithms, train models, add datasets, and improve the framework. Please refer to `AGENTS.md` for AI-assisted development guidelines.

(Further details on model training, data preparation, and specific algorithmic implementations will be added as the project progresses.)
